        At Pinecast, we see the lack of high-quality MP3 encoders available
        to podcasters. The ones that exist are confusing and don't follow best
        practices. So we made our own, Pinecoder.

        To encode an MP3 for your podcast, export your episode as WAV, FLAC, or
        192kbps MP3 and drag it into the box below. We'll walk you through the
        rest.
